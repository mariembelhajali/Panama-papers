## Title: Study of the Biggest Leak in History
#### Abstract:

More thant 214,000 offshore entities were involved in Panama Papers leaks. 11.5 million documents were leaked and details financial top secret information.Also, criminals were mentionned in panama papers and represented the lack of ethics around the world. Taken from Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider Mossack Fonseca, some of thoses papers were created since the 1970s and were all leaked in 2015 by an anonymous source. Identifying which countries are more corrupted is an important result to deal with. Due to these papers and a detailed analysis of the dataset provided, we will be able to help goverments find corrupted companies and dangerous ciriminals. Our aim is to get a closer view about the involved countries and how distributed the papers are in the world. We want to be as close as we can to the theme of the project which is Data science for good. It's an important opportunity to treat such a subject with a critical analysis.

#### Researchs questions: 
- What are the most correpted countries? Does underdevolped/poorest countries are more affected by corruption?  
- what are the connections and there types between the officers, entities and intermediaries? Are there a commun intermediaries/entites?
- Are there any hidden patterns that will allow us to detect corruption?
- How is the evolution of corruption over the years? Is it increasing or decreasing? 

#### Dataset:

#### Internal milestones up until milestone 2:
- Recongnize and visualize connections and relationships between people, organization, institutions and countires.
- Processing the data and cleaning it because we noticed some incoherencies(example: checking duplicated entries).
- Identify useful attributes and drop those that wont need next.
- model our dataset in a graph format and learn about the nodes connections(example: connected components)
